# 🧊 Flipkart Refrigerator Analysis & Price Variation Based on Features and Energy Efficiency
This project focuses on web scraping refrigerator data from Flipkart and analyzing the variation in prices based on key product features such as brand, capacity, type, star rating (energy efficiency), and technology used.

## 🔍 Project Overview
With the increasing demand for energy-efficient home appliances, understanding how different features influence refrigerator prices can provide valuable market insights. In this project, I collected data directly from Flipkart using Python-based web scraping techniques and then analyzed the data using Power BI.

📌 Key Objectives:
* Scrape real-time data of refrigerators listed on Flipkart
* Clean and preprocess the data for analysis
* Explore how features like:Brand,Capacity,Type (Single Door / Double Door / Side-by-Side),Energy Efficiency Rating (Star Rating),Compressor Technology (Inverter / Normal)
affect the pricing trends.

## Build an interactive Power BI dashboard to visualize patterns and insights

## 📊 Power BI Dashboard Highlights:
Interactive dashboard focusing on top 10 refrigerator brands
Visual analysis of:Price variation by brand and energy rating
* Distribution of refrigerator types and capacities
* Average pricing trends based on star ratings
* Comparative brand analysis for consumer insights

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies Used:
* Python (for web scraping using BeautifulSoup / Requests)
* Pandas & NumPy (for data cleaning and analysis)
* Power BI (for dashboard creation and visual storytelling)
* Jupyter Notebook (for perfoming these task)

## ✅ Outcomes:
* Found clear pricing trends influenced by energy efficiency and advanced technologies
* Identified brands and features offering the best value for money
